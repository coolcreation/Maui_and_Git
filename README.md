Starting a new .NET Maui project that will focus on core concepts of Maui.
Updates will be pushed to Github as the project progresses.

README is in the root of the project, but not showing in solution explorer.  
To edit README go to the file on my local machine and click to edit the file.   
Then push those changes to Github!
